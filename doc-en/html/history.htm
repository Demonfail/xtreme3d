<H1 class=pagetitle>History Xtreme3D</H1><BR><B>Xtreme3D 0.x to 2.x 
(2003-2006)</B> <BR><BR><A>History Xtreme3D was launched in 2003. The engine was 
written in Delphi Using The GLScene (de facto standard 3D engine for Object 
Pascal) German programr under the nickname <B>Xception</B>. Unfortunately, we do 
not know his real name. <BR><BR>The First stable version of Xtreme3D (0.9) was 
released in 2003. Its possibilities were quite modest: supported by only the 
animated model of MD2 and MD3, static 3DS, MS3D, and obj, the built-in 
primitives, sprites, a two-dimensional and three-dimensional text, lensflare, 
particles and the heavenly dome. The Engine API resembled the style of the GML 
features. <BR><BR>The main goal of the project was the creation of the engine 
for a 3D RPG like Dungeon Master. And while the author of the engine not 
originally planned to further development of the Xtreme3D, in later versions of 
the functionality of the engine quickly evolved to meet your specific needs of 
the genre. <BR><BR>So, in version 1.7 (2004) appeared dynamic water. However, 
the much more serious breakthrough has become version 2.0 (2006): The total 
revision of the API, the support of libraries of materials and light maps, 
dynamic cubemapping, support for new formats of models, rendering in the 
texture, download resources from the compressed archive, hardware shaders (bump 
mapping, cel shading), мультитекстурирование, octree and quadtree, DDS, as well 
as, most importantly, the integrated physics engine Open Dynamics Engine (ODE). 
<BR><BR>The latest release from The Xception (2.0.2.0), in addition to numerous 
багфиксов, contained two major innovations: отрисовщик landscape and the engine 
check the collisions of DCE. The functionality of the engine was at the level of 
commercial games 1997-2003 - Xtreme3D 2.0 allowed to create something similar in 
terms of graphics on the Quake 2-3, Half-Life, GTA 3, The Elder Scrolls: 
Morrowind, and so on. - All that belongs to the "дошейдерной" era. 
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, The Xception, ultimately, abandoned its development - the 
engine distributed without source codes and, therefore, for a long time does not 
grow, and technology, however, not stood on the spot... <BR><BR><B>Xtreme3D 3.0 
(25.08.16)</B> <BR><BR>since 2009 in the Russian-speaking community of Xtreme3D 
is constantly vital idea to recreate the engine from scratch, fix bugs and add 
the missing functionality - bearing in mind that the Xtreme3D is a very thin 
wrapper over The GLScene, this task seemed simple and purely technical. However, 
unforeseen problems, and the case has been delayed. In the end, the project, 
which began in 2009, and the surviving the long period of stagnation and a few 
flashes of activity, was completed only in 2016. This is how the Xtreme3D 3.0. 
<BR><BR>This version of Xtreme3D, as well as the original, written in Delphi 
using popular GLScene library - in fact, the engine can be called almost full 
враппером GLScene for Game Maker. The Xtreme3D 3.0 is modified and extended 
GLScene 1.0.0.0714. <BR><BR>Here is a brief list of the innovations Xtreme3D 
3.0: <BR><BR>- Shader in the language of the GLSL (1.1 or 1.2) <BR>- Dynamic 
Shadows, implemented by the method of shadow mapping <BR>- Screen anti-aliasing 
2x and 4x. There is a support for anti-aliasing technology NVIDIA Quincunx <BR>- 
Quick внеэкранный rendering using p-buffers in <BR>- Support for proxy objects 
<BR>- Support for models of LOD LODka (3D) and B3D (Blitz3D) <BR>- Support for 
tags for Models MD3 <BR>- Mixing the skeletal animations <BR>- Download the 
materials from the scripts <BR>- Integrated mixing shader textures (TexCombine) 
<BR>- Integrated shader that implements the basic illumination to The Фонгу 
(Phong) <BR>- procedural textures on the basis of the resonator Perlyna <BR>- 
Support for linear waves for dynamic water <BR>- The new types of geometrical 
primitives (a truncated pyramid, the dodecahedron, икосаэдр, kettle) <BR>- 
Enhanced the effect of the explosion to мешей (in particular, now have the 
opportunity to return the mesh strainer in its original condition) <BR>- The 
Rendering nets (Grid) <BR>- Debug rendering of objects-mannequins (Dummycube) 
<BR>- many new features for the camera (Camera) <BR>- The Ability To copy the 
Transformation Matrix (local and absolute) From one object to another. You can 
also copy objects of bone matrix of the model with the skeletal animation and 
ask the local matrix of the object manually, which allows to realize any 
mathematical model of the movement and rotation of objects that are not becoming 
attached to the corners of the Eulerian model <BR>- The possibility of applying 
the pulses (instant changes in speed) to the dynamic objects in the DCE. Also in 
the DCE now supports landscape <BR>- Advanced physics of ODE. In contrast to the 
old implementation in the Xtreme3D 2.0, now in the ODE is fully supported by the 
Freeform objects (both for static and dynamic bodies), as well as landscape. In 
addition, it is now possible to set the position of the геометриям at them with 
<BR><B>Xtreme3D 3.1 (30.09.16)</B> <BR><BR>In the autumn of 2016, came the first 
update of the new branches of Xtreme3D - version 3.1. Here is a list of the most 
important changes in it: <BR><BR>- Superior API for Freeform objects - an 
opportunity to build handmade Freeform of the vertices and polygons, the 
functions of the transformation of the мешей, as well as the preservation of the 
Freeform to file <BR>- Support for new file formats: CSM and LMTS (which was not 
in 3.0), X, ASE, DXS <BR>- Support for Ragdoll In The ODE <BR>- The Object 
Movement, which allows you to specify the objects trajectory of <BR>- Superior 
BumpShader - now supports shadow maps and automatically generate the tangent 
space <BR>- Superior PhongShader - now supports textures <BR>- the object of 
HUDShape - 2D-shape (supported by a rectangle, circle, segment and mesh) <BR>- 
Superior API for sprites - now supports texture atlases (i.e., the use of 
portion of the textures for the sprite drawing), as well as drawing from the set 
point instead of in the <BR>- Support for the alpha channel PNG for the <BR>- 
Functions for questioning the size of the texture. <BR><BR><B>Xtreme3D 3.2

<BR><BR><B>Xtreme3D 3.3 (26.11.16)</B> <BR><BR>- New functions for Freeform that 
allow you to read and modify the geometry of the model (coordinates of the 
vertices, normal, indexes, etc.) <BR>- Support for replacement materials 
(Override Material) for the species and FBO. Allows you to specify a single 
material, which should be rendered objects, ignoring their own materials <BR>-

<BR><BR>- Added support for TTF fonts and display any characters through Unicode 
UTF-8 encoding <BR>- Functions Added ObjectHash (hash table for storing any 
objects Xtreme3D) <BR>- Changed API function FBORenderObjectEx - new options 
that allow you to selectively clean the color buffer and depth buffer, and copy 
the contents of the FBO in the main framebuffer <BR>- Support for transfer to 
the GLSL shader species and the back of generic matrices, as well as a special 
option, enabling the shader to learn whether there is a texture in the specified 
unit текстурном <BR>- In order to accelerate the utilization Freeform objects 
now does not generate октарные trees and vectors of the tangent and бинормалей 
during boot. This must be done manually, if necessary, the functions of the 
FreeformGenTangents and FreeformBuildOctree <BR>- Fixed a bug in the 
MaterialCubeMapLoadImage. Also in the GLSL is now operated seamless cubic
