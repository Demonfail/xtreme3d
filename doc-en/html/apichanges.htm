<H1 class=pagetitle>API Changes</H1><BR>Xtreme3D 3.x is not 100% backward 
compatible with the Branch 2.x - there are several important changes, but in 
general the names of functions and their meaning is not changed. Implemented 
virtually all of the old functionality of the Xtreme3D 2.0, except for: 
<BR><BR>- questioning the positions and normal the last clashes in the DCE and 
FPSManager <BR>- questioning the number of отрендеренных triangles <BR>- portal 
culling'a. As he worked (and worked there) in the previous version of the 
engine, it is not clear why this functionality was not implemented. 
<BR><BR>Features no longer present in the Xtreme3D 3.x: <BR>- LoadB3D (function 
worked not for all files in the format of the B3D, now this format is loaded in 
the usual way, through The FreeformCreate) <BR>- ClearZones, ZonesVisible, 
CullZones, ZoneAddPortal, ZoneObjectInZone, ZoneGetCurrent, ZoneGetNew, 
ZoneAdjustSize, CreateZones, ZoneGetPortalCount, ZoneGetPortal <BR>- 
TextSetColor, TextSetFont, TextSetText (appeared appropriate functions for each 
type of text) <BR>- FreeformSetSecondTextureCoords, MeshOptimize, 
MeshSmoothFaces <BR>- ObjectAlignToCamera, ObjectGetAtXY, ObjectSetDiffuseColor, 
ObjectStructureChanged, ObjectClueToBone <BR>- ObjectIsClipped (function is the 
reciprocal of the ObjectInFrustrum to their destination) <BR>- 
MaterialGetFromLib <BR>- MaterialAddTextureEx, MaterialTextureExClear, 
MaterialTextureExDelete (TextureEx was rewritten for compatibility with shaders 
and the API was changed) <BR>- ThorFXSetTargetAsObject <BR>- DceGetGravity, 
DceVelocityCollided, DceGravityCollided, DceCountCollisions, 
DceGetCollidedObject, DceGetCollisionPosition, DceGetCollisionNormal <BR>- 
FpsCountCollisions, FpsClearCollisions, FpsGetCollisionPosition, 
FpsGetCollisionNormal, FpsGetCollidedObject <BR><BR>We are interested to return 
some of these functions in the engine, therefore, if you have the appropriate 
Experience, knowledge and the desire to help us, please contact by e-mail 
(gecko0307@gmail.com) or via the forum (http://offtop.ru/xtreme3d).
