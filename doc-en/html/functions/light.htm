<H1 class=pagetitle>Light </H1><A class=type>Class: 
TGLLightSource</A><BR><BR><A>The Object that creates the light. Light sources 
can be of different types and have different characteristics. The analogues of 
lighting devices in the real world, which offer additional features, 
inaccessible real sources.</A> <BR><BR><A>Light sources can be of three 
types:</A> <BR><A>Omni (POINT) - shines equally in all directions from one 
point, as, for example, the lamp;</A> <BR><A>Spot (spot) - not shines in all 
directions, and within some of the cone. Highlights the only objects that fall 
into this cone. A simple example - the torch;</A> <BR><A>Parallel (parallel 
light) - simulates the remote light sources, such as the sun. The light is 
emitted in the direction of the only one axis, from the source, of the 
infinitely great distance from the viewer, and all light rays are parallel.</A> 
<BR><BR><A>The color of the lighted objects is calculated as the sum of the 
components of the Ambient, diffuse and SPECULAR from all light sources in the 
scene:</A> <BR><A>�mbient (uniform component) is the approximation of the global 
lighting, general color for all objects that are not dependent on other 
factors;</A> <BR><A>Diffuse (diffuse component) - depends on the position of the 
light source and from normal surface. This component affects the color of the 
lighted (rotated to light) parts of objects;</A> <BR><A>Specular (�������� 
component) - determines the color of the Reflection reflection of light beams 
from the surface. These glare significantly increase the realism of the image, 
because rare real surface, do not reflect light, so this aspect is very 
important.</A> <BR><A>Note that the objects themselves may also have individual 
components of ambient, diffuse and Specular, affecting the color.</A> 
<BR><BR><A>Xtreme3D supports up to eight dynamic light sources.</A> <BR>
