<H1 class=pagetitle>Skydome </H1><A class=type>Class: 
TGLEarthSkyDome</A><BR><BR><A>Skydome in the literal translation means "heavenly 
dome", "a firmament." In ancient times, people believed that the sky is a kind 
of a round dome, the surrounding land, on which hung the sun, moon, stars and 
planets. There is a well-known engraving with the image rights, The ������������ 
to the edge of the light and with amazement �������������� into the hole, 
carried out in "heavenly expanse." <BR>In reality, all that is, of course, not 
so. But computer graphics - a funny thing. In it and the sky can be dome. And 
why not? Skydome - the object of the background of the plan, so get to it, as 
the man with the engraving is impossible. In addition, there are almost all the 
effects of the atmosphere. On the dome in the literal sense of the "suspended" 
The sun and stars. The sun goes smoothly across the sky: when it is lowered 
toward the horizon, we are witnessing a sunset. And then the sky darkens and 
there comes the night. Sparkling stars as the real thing. The only minus - no 
clouds. They would have to do on their own. It probably was assumed not to 
deprive the developer to make, for example, The �������������: so that you can 
as fall to the ground and climb to the clouds and see them from a close 
distance. <BR><BR>The color of the sky in the skydome is composed of three 
components: Deep, Haze, the Night and the Sky. <BR>Deep - the color of the 
so-called nadir - the point opposite the ������; it is located under our feet. 
Usually in real life to see nadir is impossible, the earth obstructs :) But the 
color of this point is important as it determines how shade mixes up the color 
of the sky as the care of the horizon line. <BR>Haze - the color of the horizon. 
Usually corresponds to the color of the mist. <BR>Sky is the color of the 
zenith. In this color painted the entire heavenly bubble up to the line of the 
horizon. <BR>Night - the color of the night. When the sun goes below the 
horizon, this color is gradually filled in all the components of the sky, in 
addition to the Deep. This is most often black or dark blue, although there may 
be other options.</A> <BR><BR><IMG align=center
