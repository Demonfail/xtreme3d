<H1 class=pagetitle>Skybox </H1><A class=type>Class: TGLSkyBox</A><BR><BR><A>In 
addition to the skydome, there is another way to the re-establishment of the 
sky. The name of the skybox speaks for itself - this is the so -called "Heavenly 
Box" - a cube surrounding the scene from all sides. The ������ Cuba Special 
textures with drawn back the plan. This can be not only sky, but also to the 
mountains, the sea, the forest is any landscape. This is the advantage of the 
skybox. </A><BR><BR><IMG align=center src="../data/skybox.jpg"> <BR><BR><A>These 
are the textures in 3D and 2D modeling rendering by six projections on the scene 
with a camera angle of 90 degrees. In addition to the skybox, these textures 
(which is sometimes referred to as cubic or 3D) can be applied to static maps of 
cubic projection (cubemaps). <BR>In the Xtreme3D in addition to the 
above-mentioned six textures can be used another - for the clouds. As the clouds 
creates additional plane inside Cuba. <BR>You can create several "celestial 
boxes" with any elements: for example, only with some clouds. So you can make a 
few layers of clouds, to be realistic. You can dynamically animate textures to 
get the movement of the clouds. In addition, if you make any object wholly for 
the "heavenly box", it will be fixed in relation to the sky. In this way, very 
simply add the sun, moon, planets... Despite the apparent simplicity and 
primitivism, the skybox is a very powerful tool. If you approach the creative, 
you can create a fantastic beauty of landscapes. <BR>The only disadvantage of 
skybox is the limited space of the player. The landscape is not close, how would 
to him did not go. And to the clouds on the plane did not rise. So skybox is 
applicable only in those games, where the Player known to be given great freedom 
of movement. It can be action, arcade, some of the race, as well as the interior 
scenes (where the landscape is only visible from the window). </A>
