<H1 class=pagetitle>Squall </H1><A class=type>Class: -</A><BR><BR><A>Squall is a 
compact and powerful sound engine, developed by Marat �������������� (studio 
AntiTank). In the Russian �������� Squall was very popular in the "zero" and 
compete with BASS and FMOD. In 2009, the engine was opened, but the author has 
ceased its development, so we from a sense of nostalgia decided to make it part 
of the Xtreme3D. Despite the lack of development, Squall still remains an 
excellent solution for audio playback in the Games for Windows - it little 
serious alternatives to free software. The engine is reliable, repeatedly 
verified in practice, provides a convenient, well thought out API. Squall reads 
the .WAV files, MP3, OGG/Vorbis, reproduces sound in a separate thread through 
the DirectSound API (Requires DirectX 7 or higher) supports 3D-sound and 
hardware effects HRTF (CreativeLab EAX, Sensaura ZoomFX). <BR>Squall 
architecture is based on the separation of audio data from the actual sound 
sources - that is, you can download the audio file once and then play at 
different points in time and with different settings. Audio sources are referred 
to as channels (channel). A channel can be placed in 3D space - in this case, it 
set the position, speed, the parameters of the EAX and ZoomFX. The channels can 
be individually set the volume and frequency. <BR>For Squall to ����������
