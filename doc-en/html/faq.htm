<A><BR><B>1. Whether true today, use of the Xtreme3D?</B>
<br>For serious use in the industry (creating commercial game projects) - there is no more than a yes. Xtreme3D is based on the older graphic technologies (OpenGL 1.x/2.x), and, of course, could not compete with the modern движками type of Unity and Unreal Engine. However, the amateur game project, as a rule, and does not attempt to compare in terms of the charts with the AAA-тайтлами, so to create simple indie games Xtreme3D 3.x is good enough. The slider to interesting and attractive - theoretically, with it you can create a game not worse than Doom 3 or Half-Life 2.

<A><BR><B>2. What is the engine better - Xtreme3D, Ultimate3D or GMOgre?</B>
<br>All depends on the requirements for ease of study, flexibility and convenience. Ultimate3D is very easy to study, but the technologically highly inferior to the rest. GMOgre - a complex engine with a very peculiar API, but very powerful, with it you can do if not all, very much. Xtreme3D in the latest versions (3.0 and above) on the functionality of the approaching GMOgre and now knows almost everything and he is the Xtreme3D more simple architecture, inherited from the GLScene and Intuitive API.
<br>If you are just beginning to explore 3D graphics, recommend the Ultimate3D. If you already have sufficient experience in the built-in 3D graph GM if you are not afraid of the complexity and lack of documentation - you can take a look in the direction of GMOgre. If you just need a lightweight, but at the same time, powerful and well-documented 3D-engine, which can be easily explored and is easy to use - then grab the Xtreme3D. Also keep in mind that the Xtreme3D is now the only actively developing 3D engine for GM - if you have something is missing, you can make a request on the forum, and we will try to implement the features you are looking for.

<A><BR><B>3. Why does the engine does not start or is too slow?</B>
<br>as of the year 2016 (Windows 8.1) the engine should operate normally. Some problems can be linked to the видеодрайвером. Xtreme3D requires a driver with support for OpenGL 1.3 (plus several extensions to the work of individual functions) - if the Xtreme3D does not start or slow, we recommend that you update the video driver.

<BR>
<BR>
<A name="q4"></A>
<A><BR><B>4. Why does the engine departs with an error?</B>
<br>is most often an unknown error message ("Unexpected error occurred when running the game") arises from the transfer of the functions of the Xtreme3D wrong parameters. For example, the engine does not check the id's objects (pointers) on the validity, since this check cannot be done effectively. The Engine assumes that you will not pass an invalid id.
<br>The error occurs if you try to download a nonexistent texture or model. If your model contains data about the textures, make sure the engine is able to find them - Specify the folder with the textures with The MaterialLibrarySetTexturePaths.
<br>Finally, error can occur if you try to delete the object, having offspring. Always unplug the преварительно descendants or remove them using the ObjectDestroyChildren.

<a name="q5"></a>
<A><BR><B>5. Does the Xtreme3D shaders?</B>
<br>Yes, Xtreme3D 3.x introduces a complete shader in the language of the GLSL 1.1 and 1.2. Also in the engine there are a lot of built-in shaders realizing those or other popular effects.
</a>
<br>
<br>

<A><BR><B>6. How to improve the performance of games on the Xtreme3D?</B>
<br>There are several common methods:
<br>1. Use less detailed models and textures a lower resolution;
<BR>2. Divide All the playing space on the part and turn off individual parts
as necessary;
<BR>3. Turn off unnecessary or invisible at this moment objects;
<BR>4. Decrease the performance settings demanding effects (water, blurring, etc.) and
procedures (рейтрейсинг, checking for collisions and so on) or refuse to
use them;
<BR>5. Install the rendering in the event Alarm instead of the Step. FPS will increase by at
least 15%!
<br>6. Instead of downloading the same model several times, use the
duplication. It is essential to save memory.
<br>7. For large maps (or when a large number of objects) use Octree or Quadtree.

<A name="q7"></A>
<A><BR><B>7. Why is the model in the game correctly rotated?</B>
<br>The reason lies in the differences between coordinate systems. Xtreme3D uses a coordinate system where the Z-axis indicates forward in relation to the screen (Z-forward), and the Y axis - up (Y-up). You can easily fix the position,
<br>a) reorienting the model in the 3D editor, so that the loading in the Xtreme3D it is rotated correctly;
<BR>b) Making a model of a subsidiary for the manikin (Dummycube) and turning the model using the </a><A class=funclink href=functions/object.htm#ObjectRotate>ObjectRotate</a><A> (in this case, for all the rest of action instead of the model uses the dummy);
<BR>) turning the model using The FreeformMeshRotate (only for models of the type of Freeform).
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q8"></a>
<A><BR><B>8. Why does my boot models not loaded textures?</B>
<br>Library of Xtreme3D by default, load all the textures of the
working directory of the game. If the model is located in any folder (for example, Data/Models/),
you should specify it as the path to the текстурам using </a><A class=funclink href=functions/material.htm#MaterialLibrarySetTexturePaths>MaterialLibrarySetTexturePaths</a><A>.
If you are loaded at the same time, models from different folders, should create several libraries of
materials for each model and for all specify the path to the текстурам.
</a>

<A><BR><B>9. What is the mannequins (Dummycube) and what they do?</B>
<br>Mannequins is a very important type of objects. They are invisible and used to create hierarchical structures. Making a dummy parent for one or several objects, you can manage them all at once, managing a mannequin. For example, if you disable the dummy, all of its child objects will also be disabled. It is very convenient for submission to the group of objects of the same type. The second the main purpose of the dummies - the creation of so-called hinge structures (pivot), when the secondary object state are dependent on the primary. If, for example, be to get or set the object rotation, regardless of the direction of the vector, the easier it is to make the object of child mannequin and work with the direction of the use of the dummy, and to turn to the object. This structure is also used in the skeletal animation.

<A><BR><B>10. Why in the Xtreme3D do not operate mouse events?</B>
<br>Events Click on the check box only GM, while the Xtreme3D creates a new
active form on top of the old and, therefore, normal mouse events it does not work.
Pressing the mouse buttons, you can scan only the </a><A class=type>keyboard_check_direct</a><A>(</a><A class=constant>mb_left</a><A>
or </a><A class=type>keyboard_check_direct</a><A>(</a><A class=constant>mb_right</a><A>) - in this case, you checked directly
at the hardware level, regardless of the specific active window. In the Game Maker 8 You can also use the </a><A class=type>mouse_Check_button_pressed</a><A>.
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q11"></a>
<A><BR><B>11. How to stretch the game window to full screen? The Start option in full-screen mode does not work!</B>
<br>In the Global Game Settings on the Resolution tab, check the box set the resolution of the screen.
In the list of Resolution, select the desired You permission (usually one that was indicated
in the </a><A class=funclink href=functions/viewer.htm#ViewerCreate>ViewerCreate</a><A>). The tab Graphics all the same, select Start in full-screen mode,
because without the full-screen mode will be visible to the border of the window.

<A><BR><B>12. How to Make a test collisions?</B>
<br>The Xtreme3D there are several ways to do this.
<br>1. The ObjectCheck... (ObjectCheckCubeVsCube ObjectCheckSphereVsFace, etc.). They determine the fact that clashes between the two objects (or rather, their limiting cubes or spheres). This test may be useful to verify the type of projectile/purpose, the player/prize, and so on.
<br>2. For shooting in the шутерах (as well as for the implementation of the interaction of players with interactive objects and triggers) can be used to trace the rays (raycasting). Set the object emits light, and other objects are checked for intersection with the beam. You can get the coordinates of the Point and polygon normal crossing.
<br>3. For the kinematics (so that the character moved on the map and did not pass through walls) there are special test engines clashes - DCE and FpsManager.

<A><BR><B>13. How to get a realistic prospect of a camera?</B>
<br>Sometimes in order to achieve a realistic perspective requires the correction of
"optical" characteristics of the game camera. The following is an example of such correction brings
promising minimize artifacts:
<br></a><A class=funclink href=functions/camera.htm#CameraSetFocal>CameraSetFocal</a><A>(camera,120);
<BR></a><A class=funclink href=functions/camera.htm#CameraSetSceneScale>CameraSetSceneScale</a><A>(camera,0.5);
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q14"></a>
<A><BR><B>14. How to get the names of the materials that are downloaded automatically with the model?</B>
<br>materials are loaded into the current active library under those names which have been
specified in the 3D editor. You can use these names in order to change the parameters of the materials of the
model.
</a>

<A name="q15"></A>
<A><BR><B>15. Why is the landscape (Terrain) looks stepped?</B>
<br>If the landscape it looks staggered, which means the source map heights is encoded in 24 bits per pixel, not 8, as it should be. The image must be converted to black and white (256 color.). For example, in the GIMP is: Image -> -> Grayscale.
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q16"></a>
<A><BR><B>16. How to specify the transition to the next line in the text objects?</B>
<br>In objects the text of the Xtreme3D symbol '#' does not mean the transition to the next row. This is the thirteenth ASCII character (carriage return) - </a><A class=type>chr</a><A>(13), for example:
<br></a><A class=funclink href=functions/fonttext.htm#TextSetText>TextSetText</a><A>(text,'Line1' </a>
<a class=type>chr</a><A>(13) 'Line2');
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q17"></a>
<A><BR><B>17. How to display the Cyrillic text objects?</B>
<br>Use a font TTFont and stream objects text strings in UTF-8 encoding.
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q18"></a>
<A><BR><B>18. Does the Xtreme3D video playback?</B>
<br>No. To play the videos will need to use the custom DLL.
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q19"></a>
<A><BR><B>19. Why do the bodies of the ODE attached not force?</B>
<br>the fact of the matter is that in Xtreme3D 2.0.2.0 the opportunity to switch off bodies, if they are inactive some time, and the solids off unable to apply force. Auto power off by default activated, you need to simply turn off: OdeWorldSetAutoDisableFlag(false);
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q20"></a>
<A><BR><B>20. Does the ODE тр€пичные "Dolls" (ragdoll)?</B>
<br>Yes, ODE in the Xtreme3D 3.1 supports the Ragdoll for actors (actor).
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a name="q21"></a>
<A><BR><B>21. Why does the material does not take into account the alpha channel texture?</B>
<br>need to adjust the mixing mode </a><A class=constant>bmTransparency</a><A> The </a><A class=funclink href=functions/material.htm#MaterialSetBlendingMode>MaterialSetBlendingMode</a><A>.
