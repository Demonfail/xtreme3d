<A>In the light of the surface is calculated as the sum of the components of the 
ambient, diffuse and specular from all light sources in the scene (ideally from 
all, often neglected by many). Impact on the value of each source of light 
depends on the distance between the light source and a point on the surface. 
<BR>Uniform component of light (<B>ambient</B>) - the approximation of the 
global lighting, "initial" lighting for each point of the scene, in which all 
points covered equally and illumination does not depend on other factors. 
<BR>The diffuse component of the light (<B>diffuse</B>) depends on the position 
of the light source and from normal surface. This component of lighting is 
different for each of the peaks of the object that gives them the volume. The 
light is no longer fills in the surface of the same shade. <BR>�������� 
component of light (<B>specular</B>) is manifested in the specks of reflected 
rays of light from the surface. For its calculation, in addition to the vector 
of the source of light and normal, used two of the Vector: vector of the 
Direction sight and the vector of reflection. �������� component first proposed 
Fong. These glare significantly increase the realism of the image, because rare 
real surface, do not reflect light, so the specular component is very important, 
especially when driving, because the lens flare i can change the position of the 
camera or the object itself. In the future, researchers have invented different 
ways to calculate this component, the more complicated (�����, Cook Torrance, 
Ward), taking into account the energy distribution of light, his absorption of 
the materials and dissipate in the form of diffuse component. <BR></A>
