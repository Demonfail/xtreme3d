<a class=type>Z-Buffer | The Z-buffer</a>

<A>
part of the graphics memory, which stores the distance from a point in space up to the screen plane (Z value).
The Z-buffer determines which of the many overlapping dots closest to the plane of the observation. As well as
increasing the number of bits per pixel for color in the frame buffer corresponds to a greater number of colors,
available in the system image, and the number of bits per pixel in the Z-buffer corresponds to a greater number of
elements. Usually, the Z-buffer has no less than 16 bits per pixel for submission to the color depth.
Some of the realization of the Z-buffer is used for storing is not
an integer value depth, and a floating point value from 0 to 1.
