<a class=type>The Utah Teapot Kettle | Utah</a>

Kettle of Utah, or kettle Newell - a computer model, which has become one of the reference objects in the community of
3D computer graphics. This is a simple, rounded, solid and partially concave mathematical model of the
conventional заварного kettle.
<br>
<br>The kettle was established in 1975, the researcher in the field of computer graphics Martin Ньюэллом,
participant of the program research in computer graphics at the University of Utah.
Newell needed for its work in moderately simple mathematical model of a familiar object. His wife Sandra
Newell suggested to simulate their tea set, because at this moment they drank tea. Martin took The миллиметровку
and pencil and зарисовал the entire set by eye, then returned to the laboratory, he manually introduced checkpoints of
beziers on the handset memory of the Tektronix.
<br>Although together with the famous kettle were digitized cup, saucer and the teaspoon, one only the kettle has achieved
widespread use. It is considered, that also was modeled milkman, but data about it were lost.
<br>
<br>The kettle is composed of 32 portions of the bicubic surface of Beziers, the coordinates of control points which
are the original description of the model. Points form an array of 306 elements numbered from 1 to 306.
Most of the kettle (housing) formed from 12 portions, handle - from the following four, following four portions
form the spout, cover the kettle elaborated best - it took eight portions of the bicubic
Bezier surfaces. And the remaining four form the bottom.
<br>These data have been widely distributed among professionals on 3D computer graphics and are widely used
to demonstrate and when checking algorithms.
