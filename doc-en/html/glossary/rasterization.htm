<A>The rendering method in which a raster image is obtained by finding the 
pixels belonging to the specified ���������. �������������, as a rule, segments 
and polygons (usually triangles). In generalized sense dithering is the process 
of translation vector data to raster image. <BR>Dithering is by far the most 
common method of rendering 3D graphics because of its simplicity and efficiency. 
Dithering ������������������ easily, so for rendering in real time were created 
dedicated multi-core processors, graphics ������������ (GPU), which are capable 
of ��������������� millions of triangles per second. It is DITHERING lies at the 
basis of virtually all modern 3D games. <BR></A><BR><BR><A>See also </A><A
