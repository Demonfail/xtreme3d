<A>Free outdoor graphics library based on the OpenGL for Delphi and Lazarus, 
originally developed in 1999, Mike �����. With version 0.5 Development of the 
GLScene was continued by Eric �������, and since 2006, the library is supported 
by a community of programrs, including Russia. <BR>GLScene is continuously 
evolving, adapting to modern technology of 3D graphics. In addition to the 
graphics classes and components, the library provides tools for working with 
sound, I/O, the game logic and physics. <BR>The high-level structure of the 
GLScene allows beginners to create games, not knowing any OpenGL commands, not 
presenting, as the matrix are multiplied together and how to write shaders. At 
the same time, professionals offering all the possibilities for the use of pure 
OpenGL, where necessary, modifying the source code under themselves and create 
professional applications. <BR>On the basis of the modified the source code 
GLScene is built Xtreme3D. <BR>Official site: <A class=link
