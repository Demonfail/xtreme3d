<A>One of the methods of construction of shadows, namely, the use of Z-buffer to 
determine the pixel, whether the target point in the shadows. The method of 
shadow maps based on the idea that the lit terms are those terms that "visible" 
light source. "Appearance" in this case means that this point has successfully 
passes the test depth when rendering from the source of light - that is, they 
are not superseded by other objects. Therefore, all the points that are 
"invisible" from the position of the light source, are in the shade. <BR>The 
method works in two passes: first is the rendering of the source of light - the 
depth values are recorded in a special buffer. And then done the normal 
rendering, during which the buffer is used to check if a pixel in the shade 
(this test is carried out in the ����������� �������). <BR>Usually the shadow 
cards are used with light source (such as the sun), to render the depth buffer 
is used orthogonal projection. However, the method is compatible with point 
light sources - for this instead of a depth buffer rendering is cubic maps (6 
depth buffers on the sides of the Cuba, ambient light source) from the 
perspective projection. When a large number of light sources, this technique 
greatly increases the load on the GPU, so in practice the shadow ���������� 
usually only for a few of the most important sources of light, depending on the 
nature of the ������������ scene. <BR>Shadow maps are very effective - they are 
much faster than the shadow volume. But they have and the lack of - a strong 
aliasing: In other words, if you do not use a giant depth buffer, the shadows 
are much �����������������. This artifact is usually eliminate the filtering 
(blurring) of a sample of the depth buffer core 3x3 or 5x5 - as a result of 
which are soft shadows without The ������������. This extension method of the 
shadow maps has received the name of the PCF (Percentage Closer Filtering). 
<BR>The classic shadow cards have a limited area coverage. That is, it is 
impossible to make all visible objects in the scene ����������� qualitative 
shadow - increasing the size of the projection of the reduced detail and, 
consequently, increased aliasing. When decreasing, respectively, the remote 
objects fall out of the field of view" of the light source and do not cast 
shadows of the most popular technique that solves this problem - cascading 
shadow maps (Cascaded Shadow Maps, CSM). It is the rendering of several shadow 
buffers instead of one, with different sizes of projections - they are called 
shadow cascades. Typically used 3-4 cascade. Then The ����������� ������� 
desired buffer is selected depending on the coordinates of the current pixel - 
usually a sample ������������� between neighboring cascades to get smooth 
transitions. As a result of the shadow map covers almost all the visible scene: 
are qualitative shadows in the vicinity of the camera and ����������������� - 
away. ������������ distant shadows practically not noticeable to the audience - 
he sees only that distant objects also cast shadows, and this is enough. <BR>The 
main difficulty of the CSM method is the effective location of the cascades on 
the pyramid of visibility. The most simple solution - align with the center at 
the position of the camera, but in this case, the effective area of the cascades 
will be only about a third of their real size, since each time the viewer sees 
not the entire cascade, the only part of it, the corresponding horizontal angle 
of view camera. In modern implementations of CSM position and size of the 
projections of the cascades is usually picked up so that they completely fell 
inside the pyramid of visibility and covered it as soon as more tightly. 
<BR>There is also a popular method of expansion of shadow maps - Variance Shadow 
Map (VSM). It depth buffer stores two values for each pixel - actually the depth 
and its square, this uses the buffer values with a floating point. To obtain a 
sample of the used buffer Chebyshev inequality. The advantage is that of the 
VSM-buffer can be pre-filter once, and then use for further without rendering 
the PCF, greatly increasing the productivity. However, the VSM brings its 
artifacts, the most serious of which is the so-called light-bleeding, when in 
the zone of shadows appear bright spots. There are several ways to fix the 
problem, but they either require more memory, or make the shadows not as soft as 
we would like. <BR><BR><A>See also the </A><A class=link
