<A>The interface between the program and the equipment, or between the program 
and other programs. The main gain from the use of API is the portability (it is 
possible to write one and the same software for different platforms), the 
stability (the program's ability to be compatible with future versions of 
hardware and software), and simplicity. <BR><BR>The Graphics API is the 
application programming interface between the program and the graphics output 
(usually the ���������������� and his driver). Popular graphic API (OpenGL, 
DirectX, Vulkan) developed to support hardware acceleration, but they can be 
implemented, and software - for example, there are a number of high-performance 
software implementations of OpenGL. </A><BR><BR><A>See also the </A><A
