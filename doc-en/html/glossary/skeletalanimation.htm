skeletal animation</A>

<A>For the first time, this technology has been used in the game Half-Life and 
later received a large spread in computer games. <BR>Instead of storing the key 
frames (as in the case of The ���������� animations) for each of the poses of 
the character, the use of skeletal animation implies one model in the neutral 
position and a large set of matrices that transform the various parts of the 
model. These matrices conditionally called bones. <BR>In comparison with the 
more simple, ���������� animation, skeletal has the following advantages: <BR>- 
Reducing the amount of data stored for the animation, because it does not need 
to keep all options geometry for each frame of animation, it is enough to store 
only the position of the bones of the skeleton. This becomes more relevant in 
connection with the increase in the number of polygons in the models. <BR>- The 
ability to use one set of animation for different models. <BR>- So you can 
manage your bones directly, which allows to realize the ��������� kinematics and 
the technology of ragdoll. <BR>- Allows more flexibility in mixing different 
animations and interpolate frames that, as a result gives a smooth and realistic 
animation. <BR>- The animation requires less computing resources of the 
processor and RAM. <BR>- On the skeleton, you can construct a dwelling was 
composite. For example, on the skeleton, you can "hang" at the same time, and 
the body of the character, and his clothing, weapons and various objects, then 
all of this change in dynamics. Disadvantages are that using skeletal animation 
can be done high-quality animations of flexible material such as cloth or hair, 
as well as the inability to complex geometry morphing objects (for example, 
transformation in the cube), but for such purposes, you can just use the 
���������� animation. <BR></A>
