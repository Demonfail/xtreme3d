<A>Displays the three-dimensional space on a plane by building a ������������ 
lines. In computer graphics distributed three types of projection: 
<BR><B>Orthographic</B> (orthogonal) - the location of the spectator is 
infinitely removed from the scene, so all the lines along the same axes are 
parallel. The ��������������� projection is isometric. <BR><B>Parallel</B> 
(parallel) is a type of orthogonal projection, parallel to the coordinate axes. 
Parallel to the projection may include types of Front (Front View), Thor (top 
view) and Right (Right Side). <BR><B>Perspective</B> (prospective) - Parallel 
Lines visually converge at one point. The prospect is the most famous projection 
type and, as a rule, used most often. </A>
