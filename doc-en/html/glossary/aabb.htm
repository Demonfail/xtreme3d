<H1 class=name>AABB </H1><A class=type>Axis Aligned Bounding Box | bounding 
parallelepiped, justified on parallel axes</A> 
<HR>
<A>The area in the space surrounding a certain object, in the form of a 
rectangular parallelepiped with the parties, parallel to the coordinate axes in 
the world system. When turning the object of AABB modifies its dimensions, but 
always remains focused on the axes. The second version of The AABB - the cube 
with the parties, equal to the maximum size of the object: thus, the AABB does 
not need to be converted to the transformation of the object, and in any 
position of the object does not go beyond the AABB, although, of course, with 
the loss of accuracy. <BR>AABB is used in areas such as the partitioning of the 
space, collision detection and tracing.</A> <BR><BR><A>See also the </A><A
