<A>The effect of ����������� ("���������"), arising during the photo and the 
houses of the movement of objects in the scene during the exposure time frame. 
In the 3d animation virtual camera has an infinitely small exposure, therefore, 
lubrication, such acquired camera and human eye at the sight of the fast-moving 
objects, missing - it is usually imitate artificially using directional blur 
(directional blur). <BR><BR>The blur when driving is used in almost all racing 
games (to create the effect of high-speed drive), Sports simulations (for fast 
moving objects, like the ball or washers), as well as The ��������� (fast 
movement of cold arms, hands and legs). The blur sometimes when driving is used
