in computer graphics, the term "technique" is usually the technique of rendering" - the established program is a simulation of the computer graphics of those or other physical or optical phenomena in the real world. Technique usually is an extension of one of the two main methods of rendering - The dither or tracing. Sometimes these methods of rendering is also referred to as technicians.
<br>Popular rendering technology include construction of shadows, reflections and преломлений, direct and indirect lighting, shading environment (ambient occlusion), the simulation of relief on surfaces (bump mapping), the effect of the расфокусированности (depth of field) and смазанности (motion blur), etc.
<br>Sometimes in the rendering engines under "Equipment" means a series of transactions carried out over the graphical data for the final image - building the buffers, препроцессинг, minimizing and постпроцессинг. To respect the balance between quality and performance, as well as for compatibility with a wide range of system configurations, the engine can support different sets of such operations. For example, two common techniques in this sense are the direct rendering (direct render) and deferred rendering (deferred render), which have fundamental differences in the calculation of the lighting.
