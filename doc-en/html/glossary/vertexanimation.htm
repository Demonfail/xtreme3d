animation method, in which a sequence of key frames is a series of modified positions of the vertices of the polygon mesh. When playing tops simply interpolated from one state to another.
<br>Вершинная animation received distribution in the Games Quake series and today is an alternative to the skeletal animation, due to some advantages. In particular, the animator has the ability to control any top separately, it is impossible when using skeletal animation. This allows, for example, the Animate clothing, face, etc. the elements of models, which are too difficult or even impossible to bind to the bones.
<br>Вершинная animation has its disadvantages. The main of them: memory consumption, the cost of computing resources on the Calculation интерполяций. This makes the irrational use of the topmost animation in высокополигональных models.
