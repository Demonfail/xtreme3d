<A>The method of calculating light polygons. In the real time most prevalent 
received three lighting models: <BR><B>- Flat (flat) </B><BR><B>- On the ���� 
(Gouraud) </B><BR><B>- The ����� (Phong) </B><BR>When the light flat polygons as 
a stand (this is due to the calculation of the same color for each pixel on the 
edge), so when applying the fill a polygon will appear to be continuous. <BR>The 
���� and ����� give a smooth gradation of chiaroscuro. In the model of ���� 
lighting ���������� is calculated, the model ����� - pixel. <BR>There is also a 
variety of other models of light, which in recent years have become widespread 
in 3D games and offline rendering: �����-Phong, the Cook Torrance, Ward, 
Torrance-�������, lafortune, etc. Many of them are quite accurate approximation 
to the real physics of light. In the terminology of optics the most close to the 
lighting model concept - BRDF (dual beam function of reflectivity). <BR></A>
