Vector value, indicating the direction perpendicular to the surface. The normal triangle is defined
as a vector product of two edges of the triangle. In programming, a normal graphics can be set
for each triangle, describing a certain surface, and for each of the peaks depending on the
desired result. The length of the normal equal to 1. Bringing the vector length to one with its directions
is called normalization.
