<HR>
<A>The method used to create the physical model of the behavior of the human 
body. <BR>In most cases, the rag doll is used in conjunction with the skeletal 
animation, as the principle of their work in many respects similar. And in the 
skeletal animation, and in the rag doll is a special hierarchy of "Bones" for 
the vertex shadowing model. However, unlike the skeletal animation, tops are 
moved not by predefined rules, and on the basis of the physical model of solids. 
For example, one bone of the skeleton rag dolls can be represented by a triangle 
mesh (or ���������������� or LOD'57 in order to accelerate the computing), and 
then all vertices move, as well as in the skeletal animation. </A>
