Procedural Texture</A> 
<HR>
<A>Texture is described by mathematical formulas. Such textures do not occupy 
the memory locations, they are created pixel shader "on the fly", each element 
(Texel) is obtained as a result of the execution of the commands shader. The 
most common procedural textures: there are different types of noise (for 
example, the fractal noise), wood, water, lava, smoke, marble, fire, etc., that 
is, those that are relatively easy to describe mathematically. 
<BR>Unfortunately, the procedural textures not received until the proper 
application in games. </A>
