<H1 class=name>OpenGL </H1><A class=type>Open Graphics Library</A> 
<HR>
<A>Graphics Library approved by the industrial standard, developed in 1992, nine 
leading IT-companies: Digital Equipment, Evans &amp; Sutherland, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Intergraph, Silicon Graphics Corp., Sun 
Microsystems and Microsoft. The iso is The ��������� IRIS GL, developed by 
Silicon Graphics. The OpenGL library is quite simple to use and training, has a 
very wide range of opportunities. Here are some of its advantages: <BR>The 
stability of the OpenGL is an entrenched standard. All changes made to it, 
������������ ahead and implemented so that the already existing is not ������ on 
new maps. <BR>Reliability - all applications that use OpenGL, guarantee the same 
visual result, regardless of the hardware and operating system. 
<BR>������������� - applications using OpenGL, can run on different 
architectures and different operating systems (OpenGL provides portability at 
the source code). <BR>The main feature of OpenGL - his client-server 
architecture that theoretically allows you to place the client (application 
using OpenGL) and the server (the executive part of the OpenGL) on different 
machines. <BR>OpenGL develops with the help of the mechanism of "extensions" - 
special modifications to the basic version of the API, which add new features 
and/or expand existing ones. When the accumulated solid luggage such changes 
(extensions), a consortium of the OpenGL specification releases a new version of 
OpenGL. At the moment, the latest version of the specification - 4.0. </A>
