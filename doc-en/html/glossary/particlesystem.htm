system</A> 
<HR>
<A>Animation System, consisting of a large number of very small objects whose 
behavior is defined mathematically. The particle system usually consists of 
�������� (which may be point, surface or volume, and can emit particles or sent 
in all directions) and a number of areas that define the behavior of the 
particles (attractors, the deflectors, and changers ����������). Each particle 
has the ultimate life expectancy, and can have their attributes (color, radius, 
transparency), which change during this lifetime. The particles are usually used 
for the simulation of fire, smoke and other effects. </A>
