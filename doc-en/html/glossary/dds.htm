<A>The DDS - raster graphics format developed by Microsoft for use with the 
DirectX API. It is widely applied in multimedia applications, including 3D 
games. <BR>In contrast to conventional compression formats such as JPEG and PNG, 
DDS textures stored in memory in a compressed form, and the decompression is 
done in hardware in real time. Thus, the use of the DDS allows requirements to 
video memory, Reduce boot time textures, as well as to increase the speed of 
rendering by reducing the number of accesses to memory. <BR>For comparison: When 
loading textures PNG or JPEG, the image is ����������������� programmatically, 
the result is an uncompressed RAW - moves in video memory. Regardless of the 
compression formats for storage, the texture of the occupies in the memory of 
the volume, at times exceeding the size of the source file. <BR>In addition, DDS 
supports The ����������� PIM-levels, as well as the preservation of the cubic 
maps. </A><BR><BR><A>See also the </A><A class=link href="dxt.htm">DXT</A><A>,
