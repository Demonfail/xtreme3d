<A>Parameter, which determines the depth of the interpenetration between the 
bodies. If the CFM is set to zero, the connection will be tough. If the CFM is a 
positive number, then there is an opportunity to break the connection "offset". 
In other words the connection becomes "soft" and "softness" will grow with the 
increase in the CFM. <BR>It should be noted that only with the help of the CFM 
may somehow simulate the soft body in the physics of solids. <BR>This term is 
used only in the physical ODE engine. </A><BR><BR><A>See also </A><A class=link
