<H1 class=name>Ray Tracing </H1><A class=type>Ray Tracing | Ray Tracing</A> 
<HR>
<A>The rendering method in which a raster image is obtained by tracking rays and 
their intersections with three-dimensional objects. Ray tracing in many respects 
is similar to how it turns out photographic image in the real world, and allows 
you to receive images, the approximate on the reliability of the photographs 
(sometimes up to �������������). <BR>The trace algorithm is as follows: for each 
pixel of the image from the camera position is available beam, which is then 
checked for intersection with the objects in the scene. On the basis of points 
and normal border, as well as the characteristics of the surface and a set of 
known sources of light, the color of the calculated surface at this point, which 
is assigned to the pixel. <BR>The algorithm naturally supports the 
forward-looking projection (the rays diverge as the distance from the camera), 
the selection of the Depth (only the nearest to the screen plane intersection) 
and the building of shadows (to check if the point in the shadow, is yet another 
beam in the direction of the light source - if it crosses the surface before it 
reaches the source, the point is shaded). The introduction of additional rays 
traced is expanded to support the soft shadows, reflections, �����������, 
indirect lighting and other optical phenomena in the real world. <BR>Lack of 
tracing, which is preventing the full use of the method for rendering in real 
time, is the huge amount of ���������� computing. In recent years, the 
opportunity to trace the parallelization using GPU's general purpose - it allows 
to hope for changing the situation in the future. Now possibilities of modern 
video cards allow you to organize a hybrid rendering - rasterization with 
elements of the trace for some complex effects like reflections.
