<A>This term is used to denote the type of texture. The texture is made in such 
a way as to any side could dock another the same without clearly visible seams 
docking. This is the effect of the opposite side of the images have the same 
figure. Seamless textures used mainly for landscapes, as well as for the 
�������������� large static objects (buildings, roads, water surface, etc.) 
<BR>Sometimes used animated seamless texture, consisting of a few consistently 
displayed frames - usually to simulate fluids or moving objects - the water 
surface, lava, clouds, etc. <BR></A>
