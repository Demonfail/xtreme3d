<A>The definition of the intersection of two geometrical tel. in real-time 
applications are typically used methods for detection of collisions, operating 
convex bodies (such as the scope, rectangular parallelepiped, cylinder, etc.). 
There are specialized methods for each type of bodies, and the adoption of 
effective universal methods of working with any convex bodies (for example, 
algorithms and Gilbert Johnson-����� and MPR). ���������� body are usually 
presented in the form of a set of triangles, and collision detection with them 
is carried out by the individual tests on the intersection with each triangle. 
To optimize this process in practice usually used by different types of 
partitioning of space (Quadtree and Octree, BSP, BVH). <BR>Often the algorithms 
for collision detection give at the outlet of not only the fact of collision 
(true or false), but the geometrical information about the collision - the 
coordinates of collision, normal, and the depth of the mutual penetration of 
phone fact clashes in conjunction with this information is called a pin 
(contact). A separate class of algorithms related to the detection of collisions 
is the algorithms of building contacts (contact generation). They give at the 
outlet of the multiple contacts (contact manifold), the figures of the 
projection of the intersection of bodies on the normal crossing. Such 
information on collisions of bodies is required for the calculation of the 
dynamics of solids in physical cursors. </A><BR><BR><A>See also The </A><A
