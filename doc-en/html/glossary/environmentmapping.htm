<A>One of the forms of ibl is a method of texture overlay that simulates the 
effect of mirror reflections on the surface. As a result of the use of the 
environment map rendering on the reflections it takes much less time than when 
using a "fair" tracing. <BR>Environment Mapping involves the use of one or more 
of the textures with The ����������������� or ������������������� reflections. 
The projection of the textures on the surface of the model occurs by the 
specific transformation texture coordinates. There are several methods of 
projection environment maps: <BR><B>Sphere Mapping</B> (spherical projection) - 
as the environment map is used the only texture, forming the surface of the 
imaginary of a hemisphere, the object from the viewer. This is the easiest and 
most effective method, but not realistic, as with any angle the viewer sees the 
same reflection. This method is also known as the Mirror Ball ("mirror ball"). 
<BR><B>Cube Mapping</B> (cubic projection) - as a reader ���������� uses six 
projection, forming the six sides of the imaginary cube surrounding the object. 
As a result, the effect is fully reflected from any point of the surface. The 
original images obtained by the preliminary or dynamic rendering. This method 
allows you to get the most realistic result at the cost of the high cost of 
video memory. <BR><B>Equirectangular Mapping</B> (������������������ projection 
- a method of projection used in cartography. As the environment map is used 
only the texture covering the imaginary sphere around the object. Allows you to 
get a realistic result at minimum cost of video memory (artifacts of projection 
are the "poles", but they are usually not very visible). In the rendering of 
real time, this method has been widely only with the advent of shaders, as on a 
fixed line it is not maintained. <BR><B>Dual-Paraboloid Mapping</B> (the 
projection of dual paraboloid) is one of the most modern methods. Displays the 
top and bottom of the hemisphere of environment in two textures. This method has 
little artifacts (if not take a small deviation along the equator") and is the 
best compromise between memory consumption and the quality of the result.
