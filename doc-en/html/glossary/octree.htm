<HR>
<A>The structure of the data representing the Euclidean space in the form of a 
��������� tree, in which each element is Aabb. Each cube is divided in three 
planes at 8 (usually a mutually equal) cubes. Octree are typically used to 
partition large open ��������� spaces. Note that under the "flat" ������������� 
refers to the space, in which the camera movement is limited mainly some plane: 
An example may be a �������������. For the "flat" spaces more suited quadtree. 
<BR>Like many other methods of splitting, The Octree is used to optimize the 
collision detection and the frustum culling. </A>
