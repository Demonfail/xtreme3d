<A>
Coherent graph without cycles. A tree with n vertices always has n-1 edges. Between
any two vertices of the tree there is a single route. Therefore, the tree is sometimes defined as the
minimum coherence graph. Top of the tree which is connected to the rib with only one top, called the sheet.
<br>oriented wood is a graph with a dedicated top (root), which between root and any
top there is the only way.
<br>Trees are used in various mathematical models: in the theory of formal systems, describing and
designing hierarchical structures (in particular, in the information systems, including databases),
scheduling, etc.
