<A>The compression algorithm image, used the format of the DDS. Has a few types: 
DXT1 (BC1), the DXT3 (BC2), the DXT5 (BC3), as well as the DXT1a (BC1a), the 
DXT5n (BC3n), ATI1 (BC4), ATI2 (BC5, the LATC, RGTC). <BR>The image is divided 
into fragments of 4x4. All the pixels in a fragment are two average colors. A 
fragment of the Texel - - describes the two 16-bit values of the colors and 
sixteen 2-bit values of the pixels. Thus, we get 2*16+16*2 = 64 Bits per Texel 
or 64/16 = 4 bits per pixel. <BR>The alpha channel is processed in various ways, 
depending on the type of DXT. In DXT1 texel the alpha channel describes the four 
colors. When the maximum or minimum transparency, on the texel is one bit. 
<BR>In DXT3 and the DXT5 alpha channel is set by the optional 64-bit block for 
each tekselya (thus, twice increasing the size of the image). In DXT3 on the 
transparency of each pixel is to 4 bits. In DXT5 for tekselya shown in two 8-bit 
value, defining the range of transparency. For each pixel of the alpha channel 
uses three bits, ���������� transparency in this range. <BR><BR><B>How to select 
the right type of DXT: </B><BR>1. If an image does not need the alpha channel, 
use DXT1. <BR>2. If an image has a smooth gradations of transparency (for 
example, the blur in transparency), the most high quality will give DXT5. <BR>3. 
If, on the contrary, the transitions of the transparency of sharp enough, you 
can select the DXT3. </A><BR><BR><A>See also the </A><A class=link
