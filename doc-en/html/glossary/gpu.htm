<A>The processor, designed for graphics rendering. From the central processing 
unit (CPU) is a special parallel architecture, which allows to solve some tasks 
much faster. Condition only one task must be observed parallelism. <BR>The term 
was GPU ��������������� by NVIDIA, which in 1999 released a GeForce 256, and 
called it "the first GPU in history", although the Hardware dithering and 
relevant core appeared much earlier. So, the first arcade game machines with 
hardware T&amp;L appeared in 1993 (Sega Model 2 and Namco Magic Edge Hornet 
Simulator). In consumer computer systems The first gpu appeared on the Sega 
Saturn, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 (1994-1996). On personal computers was one 
of the first dedicated graphics 3D-rendering was S3 Virge (1995), then the 
market leader has become the company 3Dfx Interactive was established, in 1996 
and 2000, the Voodoo accelerator Graphics. Since 2000, the GPU market is divided 
between the NVIDIA, ATI (now absorbed by AMD) and Intel. <BR>The GPU is designed 
for processing large arrays of similar data, such as points, vectors and pixels. 
Initially, the types of data that can be processed GPU (and the video processing 
algorithms) were strictly defined, but modern graphics processors are fully 
programmable - this means that the programr can send arbitrary data and perform 
any algorithms. This has led to the introduction of the term GPGPU - General 
Purpose GPU (GPU). <BR></A>
