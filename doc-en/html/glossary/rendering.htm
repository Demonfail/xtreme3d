<A>The process of formation of a flat image on the basis of mathematical models. 
Most often this term is used 3D-visualization - building a virtual images of 3D 
objects and scenes. The program performs rendering, is called the rendering 
engine or the rendering engine (rendering engine). <BR>Rendering can be carried 
out both in real time (that is, the rendering of animation with the immediate 
withdrawal of the received frames on the screen and a sufficiently high frame 
rate is 30 frames per second and above) and in the offline mode (i.e., without 
restrictions on the time frame). Of course, that in order to achieve high speed 
to render sacrifice volume calculations and use a simplified mathematical 
apparatus, so the engines offline rendering and produce much higher quality and 
realistic images. The rendering in real time - the basis of all modern Games, 
offline rendering is used in film and animation, design, advertising, industrial 
and scientific field. <BR>There are two basic methods of 3D-rendering - 
rendering and ray tracing. Dithering is more often used in the rendering of real 
time, a trace is in offline rendering, although it is not uncommon, and 
exceptions: for example, there are popular offline rendering engines that use 
the rasterization. There are also hybrid engines rendering, combining the 
rasterization and ray tracing. <BR></A><BR><BR><A>See also </A><A class=link
