<DIV align=justify><IMG align=center src="data/logo.jpg"> <BR><BR>Xtreme3D is a 3D engine for Game Maker, a popular game creation tool. As we know, GM is mainly focused on 2D games, and provides only basic 3D graphics functionality that is not very suitable for serious use. Fortunately, GM supports plugging in dynamic links libraries (DLLs) that can greatly expand its capabilities. Xtreme3D is such a library. Using it you can render 3D graphics of any complexity in GM. Xtreme3D supports many advanced graphics technologies such as shaders and frame buffers, and allows you to create games with high quality graphics. Nowadays it is the only actively developed 3D engine for classic Game Maker.<BR><BR>This guide was created to help beginners, providing comprehensive material on using Xtreme3D: step-by-step tutorials with code examples, a list of engine's functions with detailed explanations, computer graphics glossary and much more. We hope that this will help learning Xtreme3D, making the process easy, interesting and fascinating.
