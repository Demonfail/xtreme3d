<DIV align=justify><IMG align=center src="data/logo.jpg"> <BR><BR>Xtreme3D is a 
3D-engine for the popular game designer Game Maker 8. As is known, the GM is 
focused on the creation of 2D games, and provides only the basic functions of 3D 
graphics, is not very suitable for serious use. Fortunately, GM supports the 
connection of third party DLL libraries that greatly expand its capabilities: 
Xtreme3D - and there is a library. With its help you can render in the GM 3d 
graphics of any complexity. Xtreme3D supports many advanced technologies 
rendering (such as shaders and staffing the buffers), allows you to create games 
with high quality graphics and today is the only actively developed 3D engine 
for classic Game Maker. <BR><BR>help budding was drawn up this guide containing 
material on the theory and practice of using Xtreme3D: step-by-step lessons with 
examples of code, a list of all of the functions of the engine with detailed 
explanations, a glossary of computer graphics and much more. We hope that with
