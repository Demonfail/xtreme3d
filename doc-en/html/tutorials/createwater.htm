Gecko</A><A class=ntext> <BR><BR>The realistic animated water is a kind of 
hallmark Xtreme3D. This is really beautiful, special allows you to achieve a 
high degree of realism of the scene. However, the use of water must be 
carefully, because the calculations associated with it, quite �����������. 
<BR><BR>The water in the Xtreme3D is a flat surface, divided into a certain 
number of squares, on which there are concentric wave disturbances - you get the 
effect of "rain". Also supported are linear waves, as in the ocean - they are 
parallel, calculated on the sinusoid and uniformly moving across the surface of 
the water. In and of itself the water - only the geometry and any properties of 
the fluid, in addition to the waves, do not possess. Therefore, all other 
effects, enhancing the impression of water (reflection, sprays, physics of 
floating objects, etc.) you have to write on their own. <BR><BR>The Code 
creation of water looks as follows: <BR><BR><A>Water = </A><A class=func2link

<BR><BR><B>Resolution</B> (resolution) <BR>The number of polygons on the side of 
the grid. The geometry of the water is constructed of squares on the grid, so 
the total number of polygons is R2, where R is the value of the Resolution. It 
is clear that the higher the value, the higher the quality of water, and, 
accordingly, the speed of its work. The default value is: 64. <BR><BR><B>Rain 
time interval</B> (the time interval of rain) <BR>The effect of "Rain", when the 
surface of the �����������, creating in random places mesh wave disturbances. 
This option specifies the length of the pause in milliseconds between two 
disturbances. The default value is 500. The maximum value: 1000000. The minimum 
value is 0 (no rain). <BR><BR><B>Rain Force</B> (force of rain) <BR>The 
intensity of the disturbances; less than this value, the faster the waves of 
"fade". The default value is 5000. The maximum value: 1000000. The minimum 
value: 0. <BR><BR><B>Viscosity</B> (viscosity) <BR>The amplitude of the 
perturbation theory; in fact, the maximum height of the waves: the less the 
value, The ������������ liquid. The default value is 0.99. The maximum value: 1. 
The minimum value: 0. <BR><BR><B>Elastic</B> (elasticity) <BR>Speed of the 
perturbations. In the real world this property depends on the density of the 
substance (for example, the density of the mercury is much higher than that of 
water, so waves spread faster). The default value is: 10. <BR><BR>Another point: 
for the creation of water requires a mask that defines the shape of the surface. 
The Mask in this case - material with a monochrome image, where the black dots 
indicate lack of water, white - the presence of. Thus, we can create, for 
example, round the pool. <BR><BR><A class=func2link
