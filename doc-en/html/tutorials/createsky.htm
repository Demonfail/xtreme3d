<BR><A><B>Author:</B> Gecko</A><A class=ntext> <BR><BR>Many games an important 
part of the graphics and gameplay is smooth change of day and night (for 
example, in the RPG and games in the GTA style). In the Xtreme3D This 
functionality provides an object Skydome, the literal translation means 
"heavenly dome", "a firmament." This is a spherical form, the stage and changes 
color depending on the time of day. On the dome in the literal sense of the 
"suspended" The sun and stars. The sun goes smoothly across the sky: when it is 
lowered toward the horizon, we are witnessing a sunset. And then the sky darkens 
and there comes the night. Sparkling stars as the real thing. The only minus - 
no clouds. They would have to do on their own. It probably was assumed not to 
deprive the developer to make, for example, The �������������: so that you can 
as fall to the ground and climb to the clouds and see them from a close 
distance. <BR><BR>The color of the sky in the skydome is composed of three 
components: Deep, Haze, the Night and the Sky. <BR>Deep - the color of the 
so-called nadir - the point opposite the ������; it is located under our feet. 
Usually in real life to see nadir is impossible, the earth obstructs :) But the 
color of this point is important as it determines how shade mixes up the color 
of the sky as the care of the horizon line. <BR>Haze - the color of the horizon. 
Usually corresponds to the color of the mist. <BR>Sky is the color of the 
zenith. In this color painted the entire heavenly bubble up to the line of the 
horizon. <BR>Night - the color of the night. When the sun goes below the 
horizon, this color is gradually filled in all the components of the sky, in 
addition to the Deep. This is most often black or dark blue, although there may 
be other options. <BR><BR><IMG align=center src="../data/skydomecomponents.png">

sky, you need every step of time to change the angle at which it is on the 
horizon. The angle of 90 degrees, ������ -90 - Nader. <BR><BR><A class=func2link

a realistic starry sky with the familiar us constellations, although this is not 
as simple as it may seem. To do this you need to understand the celestial 
coordinates. In the Xtreme3D the position of the stars in the sky is set during 
the second equatorial coordinate system, which includes two values - direct 
ascent (right ascension) and declination (declination). The two values are in 
degrees, although the Astronomy of the direct ascent traditionally measured in 
hours, minutes, and seconds (1 hour is equal to 360 / 24 = 15 degrees). To 
simplify the translation of these units in degrees, in the Xtreme3D SDK is The 
RightAscension script(hours, minutes, seconds). There is also a 
script(Declination degrees, minutes, seconds), with which you can get a float 
value from the degrees of angular minutes and angular seconds. <BR><BR>Here is 
an example of the creation of the well-known of the bucket - the seven major 
stars of the Big Dipper (coordinates i took from Wikipedia): <BR><BR><A
