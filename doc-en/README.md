Xtreme3D Documentation (English)
================================
This HTML documentation is meant to be compiled to CHM format. You can use any available tool for that. We recommend our [CHM Builder](https://github.com/xtreme3d/chm-builder), which is already included here with scripts to automate the process.

Warning: documentation was initially written in Russian. This English version is mainly a machine-translated draft that will be used as a base to do proper human translation.
