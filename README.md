Xtreme3D 3
==========
Once apon a time, there was a great 3D graphics engine for Game Maker - Xtreme3D. It made possible to create full-featured 3D games with modern graphics (for that times) and reasonable framerates in a game design tool that was intended mainly for 2D games and provided only limited 3D capabilities. However, original Xtreme3D was a closed-source project, and it was abandoned by the author. Xtreme3D 2.0.2.0 (2006) was the last official release. So we in Russian Xtreme3D community made an attempt to rewrite the engine, maintaining the API as close to original as possible. This work begain back in 2009 and now is close to its completion.

This project is not connected in any way with the original Xtreme3D developer. All code was written from scratch.

The engine is written in Delphi and based on a modified version of GLScene 1.0.0.0714. It is not finished yet, the following functionality is missing: Shadowvolume, Mirror, Navigator, Tree, Trail, DCE, FPS, Partition. The code is compatible with Delphi 7 and higher (Lazarus support is  also theoretically possible with some minor changes, we will return to this when the codebase will be ready).
