Xtreme3D Documentation
======================
This HTML documentation is meant to be compiled to CHM format. You can use any available tool for that (we recommend our [CHM Builder](https://github.com/xtreme3d/chm-builder)). Warning: text encoding of all files is Windows-1251.

Note that documentation originally was written for Xtreme3D v2, and may be not up to date with Xtreme3D v3. We are working on this.
